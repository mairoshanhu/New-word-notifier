# New-word-notifier
Word of the Hour Notifier is a Python script that shows a random English word with its meaning in desktop notifications every hour. It helps you build vocabulary while working. You can adjust the interval and timeout. On Windows, make sure notifications are allowed and Focus Assist is turned off.
